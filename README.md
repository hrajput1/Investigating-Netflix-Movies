# Investigating-Netflix-Movies
This is a mini-project that aims to find whether movie lengths are actually getting shorter or not using Netflix data.

**Netflix**, which originated as a DVD rental service in 1997, has evolved into one of the largest players in the entertainment and media industry. With its extensive collection of movies and series, it presents a compelling opportunity to apply your exploratory data analysis skills and gain insights into the dynamics of the entertainment sector. A colleague has begun exploring Netflix data using Python, specifically examining a CSV file. The initial findings suggest a potential decline in the average duration of movies. Your task is to build upon this initial investigation, exploring the dataset to ascertain whether there is indeed a trend of decreasing movie lengths and to elucidate any factors that may be contributing to this potential shift.
